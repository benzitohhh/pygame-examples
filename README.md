# Pygame examples


## To install pygame (should work on OSX and python3)

```pip install pygame```


## Running in emacs

Make sure main() is called in the code.

Then `C-c C-c` (python-shell-send-buffer) should start the pygame engine.

To reload code, need to do a keyboard interrup in the console (`C-c C-c`).
